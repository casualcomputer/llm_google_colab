# Setting Up Large Language Models on Google Colab and Kaggle

This repository provides detailed tutorials for setting up and running Large Language Models (LLMs) on Google Colab and Kaggle. Whether you have access to GPU acceleration or are limited to a CPU-only environment, these guides will help you get started with deploying and utilizing LLMs efficiently.

## Features

- **GPU Accelerated Setup**: Use Google Colab's free Tesla T4 GPUs to speed up your model's performance by X60 times (compared to CPU only session). Note that GPU availability is limited by usage quotas.
- **CPU Only Setup**: A detailed guide to setting up LLMs on a CPU-only environment, perfect for users without access to GPU resources.
- **Comprehensive Instructions**: Each tutorial includes step-by-step instructions, from setting up the environment to executing the model.
- **Code Examples**: Includes complete, runnable Jupyter notebooks that you can directly import into Colab and start using.

## Tutorials

1. **[GPU Accelerated Setup](https://github.com/casualcomputer/llm_google_colab/blob/main/setup_llm_on_google_colab_gpu_accelerated.ipynb)**: This notebook walks you through the process of setting up a LLM on Google Colab with GPU acceleration. It includes instructions for optimizing your model to take full advantage of Google's hardware.

2. **[CPU Only Setup](https://github.com/casualcomputer/llm_google_colab/blob/main/setup_llm_on_google_colab_cpu_only.ipynb)**: For users without access to GPU resources, this notebook provides a detailed guide to setting up and running LLMs using only CPUs. It includes performance tips and best practices for maximizing efficiency.

3. **[Setting Up LLM on Kaggle GPU](https://github.com/casualcomputer/llm_google_colab/blob/main/setup-llm-on-kaggle-gpu.ipynb)**: This notebook guides you through the process of setting up a LLM on Kaggle using GPU acceleration. It includes steps to install necessary packages and optimize your model for Kaggle's hardware.

4. **[Running Ollama on Colab](https://github.com/casualcomputer/llm_google_colab/blob/main/setup_ollama_google_colab.ipynb)**: This notebook guides you through the process of running and serving LLaMA3 through Ollama. It allows learners to interact with LLM easily and experimenting different open-source LLM's.
